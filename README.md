# Inventory-Manager
This code is intended to perform various activity in an inventory, including product and workers
The code takes input of product name, serial, company name and details of worker. All of this works have been done using file system, for people who can not use a separate database system. 
This code has 2 different file. Create two .txt file in your pc, copy the link and paste it. Make a product file and another worker file. Product file for methods that deal with product and worker file in the methods that deal with worker

This code is my first year final project. Had a great problem to build this because everyone was using a seperate database system which I could not use.
